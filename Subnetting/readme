This is implementation of concept of variable length classless subnetting which covers all types of subnetting. The same code
can work for classfull subnetting, classfull variable length subnetting and classless subnetting.

How to run?
Download subnet.java file open terminal in that directory in which you have placed or open the terminal and 
change directory to the subnet.java file contaning folder and 
run command

javac subnet.java
java subnet

Algorithm :-
1. Take IP any IP address of the network
2. Take no of bits in network ID (IPAddress/noOfBitsInSubnetMask) the classless representation
3. Take no of Subnets You Want to form
4. Now find the IP address representation in bits
5. Find subnet mask of network
6. And this subnet mask with IP address taken as input to obtain NETWORK ID
7. find binary representation of no's till no os subnet required and add them 
    after network bit's 
8. Now find the starting and last address of the range by resetting and setting
    all the bits after this network id + appended bits
9. Repeat above process for all the subnet Ranges 



Here is sample run of the code

run:
Enter IP address  :  192.168.116.228
Binary IP : 11000000 10101000 01110100 11100100 


Enter Network Subnet Mask 24


Network Subnet Mask   11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

Enter No of Subnets Required 3


SubnetMask After Subnetting  11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000    255.255.255.192

NetworkID  11000000.10101000.01110100.00000000.

The Group 1 IP address ranges are 
11000000.10101000.01110100.00000000.    192.168.116.0
To
11000000.10101000.01110100.00111111.    192.168.116.63

The Group 2 IP address ranges are 
11000000.10101000.01110100.01000000.    192.168.116.64
To
11000000.10101000.01110100.01111111.    192.168.116.127

The Group 3 IP address ranges are 
11000000.10101000.01110100.10000000.    192.168.116.128
To
11000000.10101000.01110100.11111111.    192.168.116.255


Entire Network Address Range is 
11000000.10101000.01110100.00000000.    192.168.116.0
To
11000000.10101000.01110100.11111111.    192.168.116.255
